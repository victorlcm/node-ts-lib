# node-ts-lib

## Getting started

This is a template repository. You can create your own repository just by clicking in "Use this template" button above.

After creating your repo, you can hack the project in your own way. I recommend starting by changing the `package.json` file to include your project name.

## Scripts

- `npm start`: start the project in watch mode
- `npm build`: build the project
- `npm lint`: lint all files


Happy hacking =)
